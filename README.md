# Apple Site (2014) Mimick

This is part of **The Odin Project**s curriculum assignment [PROJECT: BUILDING WITH BACKGROUNDS AND GRADIENTS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients)

### Task:
"In this project you’ll clone the website of one of the most design-forward companies in the world. It’s not a very complex site but it uses background photos well and the navbar at the top contains a gradient that you should be able to mimic."
